## Which image should I download?

We offer two images:

### arm64

We recommend `arm64` for newer Pi models with more then 2 GB of RAM as the
hardware will benefit from CPU and memory pressure optimisations.
This will be our focus for future development.


### armhf

`armhf` has been the traditional target for Raspbian, and works best on
low RAM hardware like the Pi 2 and 3. Choose this one if you need to maximize
compatibility with software designed for Raspberry Pi OS.


## Download

If your Raspberry Pi is an earlier model, [make sure it is compatible.](/raspberry-pi/compatibility/)

Please note the schedule for new images are typically are behind the
desktop releases of Ubuntu MATE.
