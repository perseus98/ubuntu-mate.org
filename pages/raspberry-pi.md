# Ubuntu MATE for Raspberry Pi

Ubuntu MATE 20.04 is available for Raspberry Pi with separate images for
`armhf` (ARMv7 32-bit) and `arm64` (ARMv8 64-bit). We have done what we can to
optimise the builds for the Raspberry Pi without sacrificing the full desktop
environment Ubuntu MATE provides on PC.

Ubuntu MATE for the Raspberry Pi provides a complete, familiar, desktop environment
that can be used for basic desktop computing. It is also of interest to makers and
device hackers who want to target [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) for their projects.
You can prototype homebrew ARMv7 or ARMv8 based IoT devices in a comfortable desktop
environment, including building and testing your apps as [snaps](https://snapcraft.io).
The full Ubuntu archive is available to you.

For hobbyist projects, you can stick with Ubuntu MATE for "deployment". But, if
you have something more professional in mind then the applications and snaps you've
prototyped with Ubuntu MATE can be used with [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi)
or [Ubuntu Core](https://www.ubuntu.com/core). You might want to check out the
[Ubuntu Appliance Portfolio](https://ubuntu.com/appliance) too.

## Additional features

### USB Booting

Ubuntu MATE 20.10 and newer support USB booting, **but Ubuntu MATE 20.04 does not**.

### Compute Module 4

If you have a [Compute Module 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-4/?variant=raspberry-pi-cm4001000)
you can enable the USB2 outputs on the [Compute Module 4 IO Board](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-4-io-board/),
assuming your Compute Module is plugged into such a board, by un-commenting the following line in
`/boot/firmware/config.txt`.

    #dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=host

#### Enable USB boot for Raspberry Pi 4

To enable USB mass storage boot on a Raspberry Pi 4 follow these steps:

  * [Enable optional USB boot on Raspberry Pi 4](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-desktop-on-raspberry-pi-4#4-optional-usb-boot)

### Enable USB boot for Raspberry Pi 2, 3 and 3+

The Raspberry Pi 3, 3+ and Pi 2 v1.2 with the same BCM2837 SoC as the Pi 3,
are capable of booting from a USB drive. For the Pi 2 and 3 you'll first
need to [program USB boot mode](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/msd.md),
this is unnecessary on the Pi 3+ as USB booting is enabled by default.

### Firmware

The GPU firmware partition is mounted at `/boot/firmware`. The files
`/boot/firmware/config.txt` and `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt` contain
the system configuration and kernel command line options respectively.

### SSH

The OpenSSH server is not installed by default. Simply install it to
to enable SSH.

    sudo apt install openssh-server

If you install SSH then you might also want to install `sshguard`
which is highly optimised and well suited for use on the Raspberry Pi
to protect from brute force attacks against SSH.

    sudo apt install sshguard

<!--
### Steam Link for Raspberry Pi

The Steam Link app extends Steam Link functionality to the Raspberry Pi
Model B 3 and 3+ and uses the same streaming technology as Valve's
Steam Link, allowing you to play your favorite games and even spectate
VR games right from your Raspberry Pi.

Can be installed via `sudo apt install steamlink`

You can learn more about Steam Link for Raspberry Pi from Valve:

  * [Steam Link App for Raspberry Pi](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6153-IFGH-6589)

### Minecraft: Pi Edition

Minecraft: Pi Edition is a cut down version of Minecraft for the Raspberry Pi.
It is based on an old version of Minecraft Pocket Edition and offers language
bindings for Python.

Can be installed via `sudo apt install minecraft-pi`

You can learn more about how to control the player, manually build with blocks
and use the Python interface to manipulate the world around you from the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

  * [Getting Started with Minecraft Pi](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-minecraft-pi)
-->

### Redirecting audio output

If you have issues with audio, you may try un-commenting the following line in `/boot/firmware/config.txt`:

    #hdmi_drive=2

This forces the HDMI output into HDMI mode instead of DVI; which doesn't support
audio output. You can also configure the system to output to a particular audio
device.

#### For HDMI

    sudo amixer cset numid=3 2

#### For 3.5mm audio jack

    sudo amixer cset numid=3 1

<!--
### Hardware accelerated video

Most videos will play with hardware acceleration using VLC which
is pre-installed in Ubuntu MATE. To use hardware accelerated video playback
with `ffplay` you must specify the `h264_mmal` codec.

    `ffplay -vcodec h264_mmal video.mp4`

Hardware accelerated playback on the Raspberry Pi works by overlaying the
video directly to the screen. Therefore there are no onscreen controls for
playback control. You'll need to use the ffmpeg keyboard shortcuts.

  * [ffplay keyboard controls](https://ffmpeg.org/ffplay.html#toc-While-playing)

`ffmpeg` also offer hardware enabled video encoding via the `h264_omx` encoder. Here is an example:

    `ffmpeg -f video4linux2 -i /dev/video0 -s 1280x720 -c:v h264_omx output.mp4`

However if you have MPEG-2 or VC-1 video video files then **you will need MPEG-2
and/or VC-1 licenses from the [Raspberry Pi Store](http://www.raspberrypi.com/license-keys/)**.
